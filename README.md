# KNX-Playground
 KNX simple Examples, Projects and Blueprints for Juniors


Welcome to the KNX Code Examples and Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of code examples, projects, and resources related to KNX (Konnex), the standardized communication protocol for home and building automation systems.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to provide a resource for developers, enthusiasts, and professionals interested in KNX technology. It offers a variety of simple examples and projects that demonstrate different aspects of KNX integration, control, and automation.

## Requirements

To use the examples and projects in this repository, you will need the following requirements:

1. **ETS (Engineering Tool Software)**: ETS is a software tool provided by KNX Association for configuring and programming KNX installations. It is required to work with KNX devices and integrate them into your projects. Please ensure you have ETS installed and configured properly before proceeding. 

   - ETS offers a demo license that can be used for experimentation purposes. The demo license allows you to work with up to 5 virtual KNX devices. You can visit the KNX Association website to obtain the demo license and learn more about its limitations and usage.

2. **KNX Virtual**: KNX Virtual is a simulation tool that allows you to create virtual KNX devices and test your KNX-based applications without the need for physical hardware. It provides a simulated environment for KNX communication. You will need KNX Virtual to run some of the code examples and projects in this repository. Make sure you have KNX Virtual installed and set up on your system.

Please note that ETS and KNX Virtual are proprietary software tools provided by KNX Association. You may need to obtain the necessary licenses or access rights to use these tools.
